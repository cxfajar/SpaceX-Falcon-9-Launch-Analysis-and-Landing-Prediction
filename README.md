# üöÄ SpaceX Launch Analysis & Prediction | End-to-End Data Science Capstone

This repository contains a full-stack data science capstone project focused on analyzing and predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 launch outcomes. Using open data from the SpaceX API and web sources, the project walks through the entire pipeline ‚Äî from data collection and cleaning to visualization, geospatial analysis, SQL queries, interactive dashboards, and predictive modeling using machine learning.

---

## üéØ Objective

To explore SpaceX‚Äôs launch performance, understand success patterns across sites and payloads, and build a machine learning model to predict future launch outcomes. This includes:

- Collecting launch data via SpaceX REST API and web scraping  
- Wrangling and cleaning data for analysis  
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) with plots and statistics  
- Running geospatial analysis and SQL queries  
- Building interactive dashboards using Plotly Dash  
- Training and evaluating classification models to predict mission success

## üîç Key Highlights

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection

- Collected SpaceX launch data using **REST API** and **web scraping**
- Extracted JSON payloads for each launch and normalized them into structured data
- Created a historical dataset of Falcon 9 missions

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Wrangling

- Cleaned columns, standardized units, removed missing values
- Transformed features such as payload mass, orbit type, and landing outcomes
- Created binary target labels for classification

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ EDA & Visualization

- Analyzed launch trends over time, by site, and by payload
- Visualized:
  - Payload vs. Success
  - Flight number vs. Orbit
  - Success rates per orbit type
  - Yearly success rate trends

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Geospatial Mapping with Folium

- Mapped global launch sites with markers
- Labeled success/failure outcomes visually on map
- Analyzed proximity of launch sites to railways, coastlines, highways

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ SQL Analysis

- Queried launch success by site and orbit using SQLite
- Calculated average/total payloads for specific boosters
- Identified top-performing boosters and earliest ground landings

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Interactive Dashboard (Plotly Dash)

- Pie charts of launch success count by site
- Scatter plot of Payload Mass vs. Success
- Slider-based payload filter to dynamically explore trends
- User-interactive analysis to support decision-making

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Predictive Modeling

- Built and compared multiple **classification models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - SVM
  - Random Forest
- Used grid search and cross-validation for model tuning
- Visualized:
  - Model accuracy comparison
  - Confusion matrix of best model

## üìä Sample Insights

- Launch success improves significantly with lower payloads and later flight numbers  
- Cape Canaveral has the most launches, but VAFB has highest success ratio  
- Most successful missions land on drone ships with specific boosters  
- Best ML model achieves ~92% accuracy in predicting launch outcomes
